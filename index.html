    <h3><span>Title: </span>SMART MIRROR</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>Smart mirror is a device with voice activated natural language processing system . It is a virtual intelligent personal assistant with control over home devices and automation products .It recognises the person in front of the mirror and assists with his daily routine. For if he is attending a seminar it allows him to go through a check list and help him with his attire ,presentability,articulation and confidence . A virtual friend with 24/7 assistance with making purchases and ordering things online . It offers weather reports and news as provided by variety of sources including third party based.

 <h3><span>Title: </span>Deaf-blind communication using Arduino</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span> Communication is key in humans. But communication between two people who are Deaf and blind is hindered. Deaf-blind communication has come a lot way from using sign language, Face-to-Face Communication System such as Screen Braille Communicator. 
The blind person’s only way of communication would be through talking and hearing, while the deaf person can only type and see. With our device we bridge this gap and make it feasible.
Our device makes it possible to make calls, send text messages, allowing them to check the date, time and temperature without the need of a mediator. It is also facilitated with GPS technology. This device caters to the basic needs of communication between the two impaired.
This device is compact and portable and hence, this device allows a blind and a deaf to effectively communicate with each other on their own.</h3>
